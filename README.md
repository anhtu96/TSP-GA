* The main files is main1.m and main2.m, the only difference between these files is the method of crossover. The first main file uses PMX method, whereas the other one uses another method.
* USAGE:
  - Open main1.m or main2.m, and just click run. Wait for it, and the result will appear on the Command Window.
  - If the result is still doubtful, you may want to increase the population size ('popsize') or the number of loops ('iteration'), which can slow down the calculation process a little bit. Then run again.
